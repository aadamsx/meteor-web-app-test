# Metoer Web API Example Application using [fine-rest](https://github.com/aadamsx/fine-rest)

## The original issues:
#### . Could not get middleware to run on exceptions.
#### . Could not add a code to sendResult() without the requestor (web-api-user project) hanging.

## New work:
#### . Engineer the auto retrieval of the Bearer token from the Web API.
#### . Engineer the storage of Bearer token in order for client to use the Web API.
